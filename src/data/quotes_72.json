Rather, the ironist's cage is a state of irony by way of powerlessness and inactivity: In a world where terrorism makes cultural relativism harder and harder to defend against its critics, marauding international corporations follow fair-trade practices, increasing right-wing demagoguery and violence can't be answered in kind, and the first black U.S. president turns out to lean right of center, the intelligentsia can see no clear path of action. Irony dominates as a \"mockery of the promise and fitness of things,\" to return to the OED definition of irony.This thinking is appropriate to Wes Anderson, whose central characters are so deeply locked in ironist cages that his films become two-hour documents of them rattling their ironist bars. Without the irony dilemma Roth describes, we would find it hard to explain figures like Max Fischer, Steve Zissou, Royal Tenenbaum, Mr. Fox, and Peter Whitman. I'm not speaking here of specific political beliefs. The characters in question aren't liberals; they may in fact, along with Anderson himself, have no particular political or philosophical interests. But they are certainly involved in a frustrated and digressive kind of irony that suggests a certain political situation. Though intensely self-absorbed and central to their films, Anderson's protagonists are neither heroes nor antiheroes. These characters are not lovable eccentrics. They are not flawed protagonists either, but are driven at least as much by their unsavory characteristics as by any moral sense. They aren't flawed figures who try to do the right thing; they don't necessarily learn from their mistakes; and we aren't asked to like them in spite of their obvious faults. Though they usually aren't interested in making good, they do set themselves some kind of mission--Anderson's films are mostly quest movies in an age that no longer believes in quests, and this gives them both an old-fashioned flavor and an air of disillusionment and futility.", "author": "Arved Mark Ashby, Popular Music and the New Auteur: Visionary Filmmakers After MTV", "category": "disillusionment, fantastic-mr-fox, film-criticism, ironist, irony, pomo, postmodernism, rushmore, the-royal-tenenbaums, wes-anderson", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Everyone Deserves An Equal Footing.", "author": "R.E.

If ever there was a critic of the fetishizing effect of fascinating and dazzling \"leitmotifs\", it is Adorno: in his devastating analysis of Wagner, he tries to demonstrate how Wagnerian leitmotifs serve as fetishized elements of easy recognition and thus constitute a kind of inner-structural commodification of his music. It is then a supreme irony that traces of this same fetishizing procedure can be found in Adorno's own writings. Many of his provocative one-liners do effectively capture a profound insight or at least touch on a crucial point (for example: \"Nothing is more true in pscyhoanalysis than its exaggeration\"); however, more often than his partisans are ready to admit, Adorno gets caught up in his own game, infatuated with his own ability to produce dazzlingly \"effective\" paradoxical aphorisms at the expense of theoretical substance (recall the famous line from Dialectic of Englightment on how Hollywood's ideological maniuplation of social reality realized Kant's idea of the transcendental constitution of reality). In such cases where the dazzling \"effect\" of the unexpected short-circuit (here between Hollywood cinema and Kantian ontology) effectively overshadows the theoretical line of argumentation, the brilliant paradox works precisely in the same manner as the Wagnerian leitmotif: instead of serving as a nodal point in the complex network of structural mediation, it generates idiotic pleasure by focusing attention on itself. This unintended self-reflexivity is something of which Adorno undoubtedly was not aware: his critique of the Wagnerian leitmotif was an allegorical critique of his own writing. Is this not an exemplary case of his unconscious reflexivity of thinking? When criticizing his opponent Wagner, Adorno effectively deploys a critical allegory of his own writing - in Hegelese, the truth of his relation to the Other is a self-relation.", "author": "Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, Living in the End Times", "category": "irony, self-consciousness", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "So we came to say hello.

As she greeted me, I could sense the pain behind her polite and superficial smile. She started telling me her story, and within one second her smile changed into a grimace of pain. Then, she began to sob uncontrollably. She said she felt lonely and unfulfilled. There was much anger and sadness. As a child she had been abused by a physically violent father. I saw quickly that her pain was not caused by her present life circumstances but by an extraordinarily heavy pain-body. Her pain-body had become the filter through which she viewed her life situation. She was not yet able to see the link between the emotional pain and her thoughts, being completely identified with both. She could not yet see that she was feeding the pain-body with her thoughts. In other words, she lived with the burden of a deeply unhappy self. At some level, however, she must have realized that her pain originated within herself, that she was a burden to herself. She was ready to awaken, and this is why she had come. I directed the focus of her attention to what she was feeling inside her body and asked her to sense the emotion directly, instead of through the filter of her unhappy thoughts, her unhappy story. She said she had come expecting me to show her the way out of her unhappiness, not into it. Reluctantly, however, she did what I asked her to do. Tears were rolling down her face, her whole body was shaking. \u201cAt this moment, this is what you feel.\u201d I said. \u201cThere is nothing you can do about the fact that at this moment this is what you feel. Now, instead of wanting this moment to be different from the way it is, which adds more pain to the pain that is already there, is it possible for you to completely accept that this is what you feel right now?\u201d She was quiet for a moment. Suddenly she looked impatient, as if she was about to get up, and said angrily, \u201cNo, I don't want to accept this.\u201d \u201cWho is speaking?\u201d I asked her. \u201cYou or the unhappiness in you? Can you see that your unhappiness about being unhappy is just another layer of unhappiness?\u201d She became quiet again. \u201cI am not asking you to do anything. All I'm asking is that you find out whether it is possible for you to allow those feelings to be there. In other words, and this may sound strange, if you don't mind being unhappy, what happens to the unhappiness? Don't you want to find out?\u201d She looked puzzled briefly, and after a minute or so of sitting silently, I suddenly noticed a significant shift in her energy field. She said, \u201cThis is weird. I 'm still unhappy, but now there is space around it. It seems to matter less.\u201dThis was the first time I heard somebody put it like that: There is space around my unhappiness. That space, of course, comes when there is inner acceptance of whatever you are experiencing in the present moment.I didn't say much else, allowing her to be with the experience. Later she came to understand that the moment she stopped identifying with the feeling, the old painful emotion that lived in her, the moment she put her attention on it directly without trying to resist it, it could no longer control her thinking and so become mixed up with a mentally constructed story called \u201cThe Unhappy Me.\u201d Another dimension had come into her life that transcended her personal past \u2013 the dimension of Presence. Since you cannot be unhappy without an unhappy story, this was the end of her unhappiness. It was also the beginning of the end of her pain-body. Emotion in itself is not unhappiness. Only emotion plus an unhappy story is unhappiness. When our session came to an end, it was fulfilling to know that I had just witnessed the arising of Presence in another human being. The very reason for our existence in human form is to bring that dimension of consciousness into this world. I had also witnessed a diminishment of the pain-body, not through fighting it but through bringing the light of consciousness to it.", "author": "Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose", "category": "inspirational, life-changing", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Some mistakes... just have greater consequences than others.

According to his own reluctant account, he came this close to going up a smokestack of a crematorium there: \"I had just been assigned to the Sonderkommando,\" he said to me, \"when the order came from Himmler to close the ovens down.\" Sonderkommando means special detail. At Auschwitz it meant a very special detail indeed--one composed of prisoners whose duties were to shepherd condemned persons into gas chambers, and then to lug their bodies out. When the job was done, the members of the Sonderkommando were themselves killed. The first duty of their successors was to dispose of their remains. Gutman told me that many men actually volunteered for the Sonderkommando. \"Why?\" I asked him. \"If you would write a book about that,\" he said, \"and give the answer to that question, that 'Why?'--you would have a very great book.\" \"Do you know the answer?\" I said. \"No,\" he said, \"That is why I would pay a great deal of money for a book with the answer in it.\" \"Any guesses?\" I said. \"No,\" he said, looking me straight in the eye, \"even though I was one of the ones who volunteered.\"He went away for a little while, after having confessed that. And he thought about Auschwitz, the thing he liked least to think about. And he came back, and he said to me: \"There were loudspeakers all over the camp,\" he said, \"and they were never silent for long. There was much music played through them. Those who were musical told me it was often good music--sometimes the best.\" \"That's interesting,\" I said. \"There was no music by Jews,\" he said. \"That was forbidden.\" \"Naturally,\" I said. \"And the music was always stopping in the middle,\" he said, \"and then there was an announcement. All day long, music and announcements.\" \"Very modern,\" I said. He closed his eyes, remembered gropingly. \"There was one announcement that was always crooned, like a nursery rhyme. Many times a day it came. It was the call for the Sonderkommando.\" \"Oh?\" I said. \"Leichent\u00e4rger zu Wache,\" he crooned, his eyes still closed.

I\u2019m not criticizing God, if that\u2019s what you think, because nobody knows why God does things or how He thinks, and He\u2019s humongously smarter than any of us, even smarter than Ed. They say He works in mysterious ways, which is for sure true. What I\u2019m saying is, maybe the whole praying business is a human idea, maybe God never asked us to do it. Yeah, all right, He wants us to like Him, and He wants us to respect Him, so we\u2019ll live right and do good. But God is good\u2014right?\u2014and to be really good you\u2019ve got to have humility, we all know that, so then if God is the best of the best, then He\u2019s also the humblest of the humble. Right? So maybe it embarrasses Him to be praised like around the clock, to be called great and mighty all the time.

Tolkien, on the other hand, denied this unequivocally. But intended or otherwise, there can be little doubt that for many it has become a religious book. The \"Frodo Lives\" buttons are not entirely a joke, because something at least comes to life through those fifteen hundred pages, although inevitably it is hard to say just what. It seems to have something to do with the way Tolkien has of making us see the quididity of things like wood, bread, stone, milk, iron, as though we have never seen them before or not for a long time, which is probably the truth of the matter; his landscapes set deeper echoes going in us than any message could. He gives us back a sense that we have mostly lost of the things of the earth, and because we are ourselves of the earth, whatever else, we are given back too some sense of our own secret.

Even those rarer men who think beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the value of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure life without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the individual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as humanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is capable of such a feeling?

What primarily distinguishes fundamentalists from other religious practitioners, in fact, is the extreme importance they give to the body: what it does, what parts of it appear in public, what goes into and comes out of it. Even when fundamentalist norms require hiding a part of the body behind a veil, headscarf, or other articles of clothing, they are really signaling its extraordinary importance. Women\u2019s bodies are obviously the object of the most obsessive scrutiny and regulation in religious fundamentalism, but no bodies are completely exempt from examination and control\u2014men\u2019s bodies, adolescents\u2019 bodies, infants\u2019 bodies, even the bodies of the dead. The fundamentalist body is powerful, explosive, precarious, and that is why it requires constant inspection and care\u2026Nationalist fundamentalisms similarly concentrate on bodies through their attention to and care for the population. The nationalist policies deploy a wide range of techniques for corporeal health and welfare, analyzing birthrates and sanitation, nutrition and housing, disease control and reproductive practices. Bodies themselves constitute the nation, and thus the nation\u2019s highest goal is their promotion and preservation. Like religious fundamentalisms, however, nationalisms, although their gaze seems to focus intently on bodies, really see them merely as an indication or symptom of the ultimate, transcendent object of national identity. With its moral face, nationalism looks past the bodies to see national character, whereas with its militarist face, it sees the sacrifice of bodies in battle as revealing the national spirit. The martyr or the patriotic soldier is thus for nationalism too the paradigmatic figure for how the body is made to disappear and leave behind only an index to a higher plane.

The public is aware the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one. In these conditions, the same innocuous conversation becomes fascinating because the public is participating in the scene.

There is a bomb beneath you and it is about to explode!\" In the first case we have given the public fifteen seconds of surprise at the moment of the explosion.

There were posters all over the wall with Wyatt\u2019s solemn, oval face on them. She wore her customary scowl, her dark eyes tracking their every move through the bunk. There was\u00a0a giant\u00a0marble statue of a sad-looking Vik with a boot on top of its head. The Vik statue clutched two very, very tiny hands together in a gesture of supplication, its eyes trained upward on the unseen stomper, an inscription at its base, WHY, OH WHY, DID I CROSS WYATT ENSLOW?Tom began to laugh.\u201cShe didn\u2019t do it to the bunk,\u201d Vik insisted. \u201cShe must\u2019ve done something to our processors.\u201dThat much was obvious. If Wyatt was good at anything, it was pulling off tricks with the neural processors, which could pretty much be manipulated to show them anything. This was some sort of illusion she was making them see, and Tom heartily approved.He stepped closer to the walls to admire some of the photos\u00a0pinned there, freeze-frames of some of Vik\u2019s more embarrassing moments at the Spire: that time Vik got\u00a0a computer virus\u00a0that convinced him he was a sheep, and he\u2019d crawled around on his hands and knees chewing on plants in the arboretum. Another was Vik gaping in dismay as Wyatt won the war games.\u201cMy hands do not look like that.\u201d Vik jabbed a finger at the statue and its abnormally tiny hands. Wyatt had relentlessly mocked Vik for having small, delicate hands ever since Tom had informed her it was the proper way to counter one of Vik\u2019s nicknames for her, \u201cMan Hands.\u201d Vik had mostly\u00a0abandoned\u00a0that nickname for \u201cEvil Wench,\u201d and Tom suspected it was due to the delicate-hands gibe.Just then, Vik\u2019s new roommate bustled into the bunk.He was a tall, slim guy with curly black hair and a pointy look to his face. Tom had seen him around, and he called up his profile from memory:NAME: Giuseppe NicholsRANK: USIF, Grade IV Middle, Alexander DivisionORIGIN: New York, NYACHIEVEMENTS: Runner-up, Van Cliburn International Piano CompetitionIP: 2053:db7:lj71::291:ll3:6e8SECURITY STATUS: Top Secret LANDLOCK-4Giuseppe must\u2019ve been able to see the bunk\u00a0template, too, because he stuttered to a stop, staring up at the statue. \u201cDid you really program a giant\u00a0statue of yourself into your bunk\u00a0template? That\u2019s so narcissistic.\u201dTom smothered his laughter. \u201cWow. He already has your number, man.\u201dVik shot him a look of death as Tom backed out of the bunk.", "author": "S.J.

Yet the record suggests that this was a fairly common occurrence and one of the occupational hazards of being a troubadour. The most famous crime passionnel of the epoch was the murder of Guilhem de Cabestanh, a troubadour knight whose love for the Lady Seremonda aroused the jealousy of her husband, Raimon de Castel-Roussillon. The story goes that Raimon killed Guilhem while he was out hunting, removed the heart from the body, and had it served to his wife for dinner, cooked and seasoned with pepper. Then comes the great confrontation:\u201cAnd when the lady had eaten of it, RAimon de Castel-Roussillon said unto her: \u201cKnow you of what you have eaten?\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know not, save that the taste thereof is good and savoury.\u2019 Then he said to her that that she had eaten of was in very truth the head of SIr Guilhem of Cabestanh, and caused the head to be brought before her, that she might the more readily believe it. And when the lady had seen and heard this, she straightway fell into a swoon, and when she was recovered of it, she spake and said: \u201cOf a truth, my Lord, such good meat have you given me that never more will I eat of other.\u201dTHen he, hearing this, ran upon her with his sword and would have struck at her head, but the lady ran to a balcony, and cast herself down, and so died.\u201d...the story is probably apocryphal\u2026 grisly details...borrowed from an ancient legend...the Middle Ages believed it and drew the intended moral conclusion-that husbands should leave well enough alone.

They are full of passion all the time, but it is the passion of a gambler rather than a lover, cold, calculating and dangerous. Some are so persistent that their whole lives, long after their youth is spent, are made an eternal adventure by this expectation. Each of their days is resolved into hundreds of small sensual experiences - a look exchanged in passing, a fleeting smile, knees brushing together as a couple sit opposite each other - and the year, in its own turn, dissolves into hundreds of such days in which sensuous experience is the constantly flowing, nourishing, inspiring source of life.", "author": "Stefan Zweig, The Burning Secret and other stories", "category": "heartbreaker, ladies-man, ladykiller, libertine, lust, philanderer, playboy, rake, seducer, seduction, sensualist, sensuality, sensuous, womanizer", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "The young habitually mistake lust for love, they're infested with idealism of all kinds.", "author": "Margaret Atwood, The Blind Assassin", "category": "love, lust, young-love", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Tis better to have love and lustThan to let our apparatus rust.", "author": "Kurt Vonnegut Jr., God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian", "category": "double-entendre, lechery, love, lust", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "But, though I was very much in lust with him, I knew from the start we were nothing like \"forever.\" Maybe because forever is such a scary place.", "author": "Ellen Hopkins, Burned", "category": "forever, love, lust, scary", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "I think sex with him might undo my essential cellular cohesion.", "author": "Karen Marie Moning, Faefever", "category": "lust, mac, v-lane", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Michael was still an enigma, wrapped in a riddle, coated in yum.

He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.\" The truth is that we cannot receive anything from God if we don't submit ourselves to The Word. The Lord Jesus was able to defeat the devil because, He was living a submitted life, a true life full of testimony. Today, most people want to receive or to hear from God without even submit their lives to the complete word in order not to lean on your own decisions, your own understanding. God listens to those that are submitting their lives to His word!

Take it from me that at the very same moment - see, the man is now holding on to the bar by his fingertips alone - at the very same moment, a good number of the women in these boxes are ardently lusting after that man, not so much for his beauty as for the danger he courts.'The voice subtly changed its tone, suddenly becoming more interested. 'You have singularly pale eyes this evening, my dear Freneuse. You ought to give up bromides and take valerian instead. You have a charming and curious soul, but you must take command of its changes. You are too ardently and too obviously covetous, this evening, of the death - or at least the fall - of that man.'I did not reply. The Marquis de V... was quite right.
