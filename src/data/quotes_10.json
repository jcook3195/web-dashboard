You\u2019ve been a consultant for a long time, and you\u2019ve dealt a great deal with top secret information. But you\u2019re about to receive a whole slew of special clearances, maybe fifteen or twenty of them, that are higher than top secret.I\u2019ve had a number of these myself, and I\u2019ve known other people who have just acquired them, and I have a pretty good sense of what the effects of receiving these clearances are on a person who didn\u2019t previously know they even existed. And the effects of reading the information that they will make available to you.First, you\u2019ll be exhilarated by some of this new information, and by having it all\u2014so much! incredible!\u2014suddenly available to you. But second, almost as fast, you will feel like a fool for having studied, written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of all this information, which presidents and others had and you didn\u2019t, and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldn\u2019t even guess. In particular, you\u2019ll feel foolish for having literally rubbed shoulders for over a decade with some officials and consultants who did have access to all this information you didn\u2019t know about and didn\u2019t know they had, and you\u2019ll be stunned that they kept that secret from you so well.You will feel like a fool, and that will last for about two weeks. Then, after you\u2019ve started reading all this daily intelligence input and become used to using what amounts to whole libraries of hidden information, which is much more closely held than mere top secret data, you will forget there ever was a time when you didn\u2019t have it, and you\u2019ll be aware only of the fact that you have it now and most others don\u2019t \u2026 and that all those other people are fools.Over a longer period of time\u2014not too long, but a matter of two or three years\u2014you\u2019ll eventually become aware of the limitations of this information. There is a great deal that it doesn\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s often inaccurate, and it can lead you astray just as much as the New York Times can. But that takes a while to learn.In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from anybody who doesn\u2019t have these clearances. Because you\u2019ll be thinking as you listen to them: \u201cWhat would this man be telling me if he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his predictions and recommendations?\u201d And that mental exercise is so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening. I\u2019ve seen this with my superiors, my colleagues \u2026 and with myself.You will deal with a person who doesn\u2019t have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since you\u2019ll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You\u2019ll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The danger is, you\u2019ll become something like a moron.

Unfortunately, that kind of education is virtually calculated to bore and alienate gifted minds. But instead of making exceptions where it would do the most good, the educational bureaucracy often prefers not to be bothered.In my case, for example, much of the schooling to which I was subjected was probably worse than nothing. It consisted not of real education, but of repetition and oppressive socialization (entirely superfluous given the dose of oppression I was getting away from school). Had I been left alone, preferably with access to a good library and a minimal amount of high-quality instruction, I would at least have been free to learn without useless distractions and gratuitous indoctrination. But alas, no such luck.Let\u2019s try to break the problem down a bit. The education system [\u2026] is committed to a warm and fuzzy but scientifically counterfactual form of egalitarianism which attributes all intellectual differences to environmental factors rather than biology, implying that the so-called 'gifted' are just pampered brats who, unless their parents can afford private schooling, should atone for their undeserved good fortune by staying behind and enriching the classroom environments of less privileged students.This approach may appear admirable, but its effects on our educational and intellectual standards, and all that depends on them, have already proven to be overwhelmingly negative. This clearly betrays an ulterior motive, suggesting that it has more to do with social engineering than education. There is an obvious difference between saying that poor students have all of the human dignity and basic rights of better students, and saying that there are no inherent educationally and socially relevant differences among students. The first statement makes sense, while the second does not.The gifted population accounts for a very large part of the world\u2019s intellectual resources. As such, they can obviously be put to better use than smoothing the ruffled feathers of average or below-average students and their parents by decorating classroom environments which prevent the gifted from learning at their natural pace. The higher we go on the scale of intellectual brilliance \u2013 and we\u2019re not necessarily talking just about IQ \u2013 the less support is offered by the education system, yet the more likely are conceptual syntheses and grand intellectual achievements of the kind seldom produced by any group of markedly less intelligent people.

When I was small I never understood why he is so simple actually I disliked it. He use to go to office and return late and have dinner with us. I use to think he never stood for me on anything. But he was the person who uses to take me to the market for Diwali shopping. He uses to give me 20 Rs to eat at school when he had only 30. He tried to fulfill all my wishes in his range. He uses to take me on his bicycle after school tuition and walk while making me sit on bicycle. He uses to scare away lizards for me. He uses to play with me. He was the one who told me to work hard when I failed. He never scolded me for studies but only when I killed an insect intentionally. He was the one who taught me physics and mathematics.Once he found a wounded parrot on the road and he bought him home. He brought medicine for him and applied it on his wounds. Later on a cat took that parrot and he ran after her but the parrot died. He did not had proper food for three four days.He spent each and every penny of his earning for our happiness and never forgot to return any pending amount. He use to talk to us but very less and joke sometimes. His style was very different, we use to tell him to use dye or color on his hairs but he always refused. And when he smiled and laughed he doesn\u2019t stop. For every question he had one answer:-\u201cTRUST GOD HE WILL DO EVERYTHING,HE IS THE ONE WHO DOES EVERYTHING\u201d. He uses to discuss with us lot on Bhagwat Gita. Once he told me:- \u201c Bade prem se milna jag mae sabse aye insaan na jane kis vesh mae tujse mil jayen bhagwaan(meet each person with full love as you never know in which form god will come in front of you)\u201d.To that I replied:-\u201c But according to Bhagwat gita this is kalyug and all will deceive you if you do that\u201d. He never drunk alcohol or had non-veg.His habits were like \u2013\u201cIf he don\u2019t want to do something he will not do it\u201d. But later on he started consulting me (A foolish person like me).I use to shout at him each time I was leaving home as he use to put my wallet at some secret safe place. And when he had not kept it even I use to say \u201cyou must have kept it\u201d. He just kept quiet. But later I came to know about the place and it was always the same and I myself realized that why am I shouting at him. Once he said to me \u201c bache apne aap he sekhtae hain(Children learn by themselves)\u201d. I daily use to woke up walk up to him and say something and then lie down beside him and sleep again. I had lot of fights with him and he was never angry on me. He was just realizing that I am becoming responsible son and we had lot of dreams together and we use to plan a lot.His smile, his eyes, his habits, his innocence, his politeness , his sense of responsibility , his teachings , his knowledge ,his humble nature, his moral values, his love for humans and animals, being non arrogant , no anger, he was never hungry for money , his voice :-\u201c hello Sonu beta , theak ho ( My Son \u2013 Sonu , are you fine)\u201d , his watch, his mobile case, his phone, his shoes, his specs , his laugh, his jokes and all the qualities that were infinite.", "author": "Amit Dixit", "category": "children, father, fatherhood, god, knowledge, papa, parents, son", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "From one thing, know ten thousand things.", "author": "Miyamoto Musashi", "category": "knowledge, learning", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Dare to research on the originality of any information.", "author": "Lailah Gifty Akita", "category": "dare, education, knowledge, lifelong-learner, originality, research, self-education", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Words and numbers are of equal value, for in the cloak of knowledge one is warp and the other woof.", "author": "Norton Juster", "category": "education, knowledge, learning", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Graduate school introduces student to extensive knowledge search.", "author": "Lailah Gifty Akita", "category": "education, graduate-school, knowledge, research, self-motivation, students", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "It's worse than treachery.

Sure, this turns out to be a subjective analysis, but in the process your own attitudes toward financial risk and reward are revealed.By contrast, personal risk usually defies quantification. It's a matter of values and priorities, an expression of who you are. \"Playing it safe\" may simply mean you do not weigh heavily the compromises inherent in the status quo. The financial rewards of the moment may fully compensate you for the loss of time and fulfillment. Or maybe you just don't think about it. On the other hand, if time and satisfaction are precious, truly priceless, you will find the cost of business failure, so long as it does not put in peril the well-being of you or your family, pales in comparison with the personal risks of no trying to live the life you want today.Considering personal risk forces us to define personal success. We may well discover that the business failure we avoid and the business success we strive for do not lead us to personal success at all. Most of us have inherited notions of \"success\" from someone else or have arrived at these notions by facing a seemingly endless line of hurdles extending from grade school through college and into our careers. We constantly judge ourselves against criteria that others have set and rank ourselves against others in their game. Personal goals, on the other hand, leave us on our own, without this habit of useless measurement and comparison.Only the Whole Life Plan leads to personal success. It has the greatest chance of providing satisfaction and contentment that one can take to the grave, tomorrow. In the Deferred Life Plan there will always be another prize to covet, another distraction, a new hunger to sate.

A certain streak of genius makes an ominous impression on them, for there exists a deep gulf between genius and the teaching profession.

As far as teachers are concerned, they define young geniuses as those who are bad, disrespectful, smoke at fourteen, fall in love at fifteen, can be found at sixteen hanging out in bars, read forbidden books, write scandalous essays, occasionally stare down a teacher in class, are marked in the attendance book as rebels, and are budding candidates for room-arrest. A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk. The question of who suffers more acutely at the other's hands - the teacher at the boy's, or vice versa - who is more of a tyrant, more of a tormentor, and who profanes parts of the other's soul, student or teacher, is something you cannot examine without remembering your own youth in anger and shame. yet that s not what concerns us here. We have the consolation that among true geniuses the wounds almost always heal. As their personalities develop, they create their art in spite of school. Once dead, and enveloped by the comfortable nimbus of remoteness, they are paraded by the schoolmasters before other generations of students as showpieces and noble examples. Thus teh struggle between rule and spirit repeats itself year after year from school to school. The authorities go to infinite pains to nip the few profound or more valuable intellects in the bud.

The simple answer is, \"Because they're scared.\" I used to suspect that children's defeatism had something to do with their bad work in school, but I thought I could clear it away with hearty cries of \"Onward! You can do it!\" What I now see for the first time is the mechanism by which fear destroys intelligence, the way it affects a child's whole way of looking at, thinking about, and dealing with life. So we have two problems, not one: to stop children from being afraid, and then to break them of the bad thinking habits into which their fears have driven them.What is most surprising of all is how much fear there is in school. Why is so little said about it. Perhaps most people do not recognize fear in children when they see it. They can read the grossest signs of fear; they know what the trouble is when a child clings howling to his mother; but the subtler signs of fear escaping them. It is these signs, in children's faces, voices, and gestures, in their movements and ways of working, that tell me plainly that most children in school are scared most of the time, many of them very scared. Like good soldiers, they control their fears, live with them, and adjust themselves to them. But the trouble is, and here is a vital difference between school and war, that the adjustments children make to their fears are almost wholly bad, destructive of their intelligence and capacity.

You don't have an open, free exchange with teachers as we often have here in the West. And further, under this design, a student doesn't do much in the way of improvisation or interpretation.This approach might work well for some pursuits, may even be preferred--indeed, I was often amazed by the way Koreans learned crafts and skills, everything from basketball to calligraphy, for example, by methodically studying and reproducing a defined set of steps (a BBC report explained how the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had his minions rigorously study the pizza-making techniques used by Italian chefs so that he could get a good pie at home, even as thousands of his subjects starved)--but foreign-language learning, the actual speaking component most of all, has to be more spontaneous and less rigid.We all saw this played out before our eyes and quickly discerned the problem.

It may even be salutary to forget. It is only when we forget the early pains and struggles of forming letters that we acquire the capacity for writing. The adult does not remember all the history s/he learned but s/he may hope to have acquired a standard of character and conduct, a sense of affairs and a feeling of change and development in culture. Naturally there is nothing against having a well-stocked mind provided it does not prevent the development of other capacities. But it is still more important to allow knowledge to sink into one in such a way that it becomes fruitful for life; this best done when we feel deeply all we learn. For the life of feeling is less conscious, more dream-like, than intellectual activity and leads to the subconscious life of will where the deep creative capacities of humanity have their being. It is from this sphere that knowledge can emerge again as something deeply significant for life. It is not what we remember exactly, but what we transform which is of real value to our lives. In this transformation the process of forgetting, of allowing subjects to sink into the unconscious before \"re-membering\" them is an important element.", "author": "Henning Hansmann, Education for Special Needs: Principles and Practice in Camphill Schools", "category": "camphill, education, feeling, forgetting, learning, memory, school, waldorf", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "When I was twelve I was obsessed.

But the true method, it seems to me, is rather to find the consitutive factors of the European community and to make them the basis of our study.This means reversing the traditional nationalist approach which concentrated the student's attention on the distinctive characteristics of the national cultures and disregarded or passed lightly over the features that they shared in common.

Many of these children are natural-born scientists - although heavy on the wonder side, and light on skepticism. They're curious, intellectually vigorous. Provocative and insightful questions bubble out of them. They exhibit enormous enthusiasm. I'm asked follow-up questions. They've never heard of the notion of a 'dumb question'. But when I talk to high school seniors, I find something different. They memorize 'facts'. By and large, though, the joy of discovery, the life behind those facts has gone out of them. They've lost much of the wonder and gained very little skepticism. They're worried about asking 'dumb' questions; they are willing to accept inadequate answers, they don't pose follow-up questions, the room is awash with sidelong glances to judge, second-by-second, the approval of their peers. They come to class with their questions written out on pieces of paper, which they surreptitiously examine, waiting their turn and oblivious of whatever discussion their peers are at this moment engaged in. Something has happened between first and twelfth grade. And it's not just puberty. I'd guess that it's partly peer pressure not to excel - except in sports, partly that the society teaches short-term gratification, partly the impression that science or mathematics won't buy you a sports car, partly that so little is expected of students, and partly that there are few rewards or role-models for intelligent discussion of science and technology - or even for learning for it's own sake. Those few who remain interested are vilified as nerds or geeks or grinds. But there's something else. I find many adults are put off when young children pose scientific questions. 'Why is the Moon round?', the children ask. 'Why is grass green?', 'What is a dream?', 'How deep can you dig a hole?', 'When is the world's birthday?', 'Why do we have toes?'. Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation, or ridicule, or quickly move on to something else. 'What did you expect the Moon to be? Square?' Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys the grown-ups. A few more experiences like it, and another child has been lost to science.", "author": "Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark", "category": "carl-sagan, education, science", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "Speaking is like conducting an orchestra; but instead of music, you are directing emotions.", "author": "Anthony Eldridge Rogers", "category": "alternative-education, education, jumpfallfly, philosophy", "rating": "0"}, {"quote": "I no longer believe that the current education system is able to equip our children for a fast-moving future.
